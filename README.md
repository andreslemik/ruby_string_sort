# ruby_string_sort
it accepts a string and rearranges the string as follows:
The most frequent characters come first and the least frequent characters come last.

The string is sorted in such a way that, in the output/result string, characters which occur the most number of times are placed first followed by less frequently occurring characters and ending with the least frequent characters.
